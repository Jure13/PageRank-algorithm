# PageRank-algorithm
An implementation of PageRank algorithm.

I do not own this algorithm or any part of the code - much of it was influenced by this GfG article (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-rank-algorithm-implementation/) and the excellent wikipedia page (https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwismKKpyfH8AhVItKQKHeKhAs4QFnoECAwQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPageRank&usg=AOvVaw11hBbSGWwAejddTl85_ROQ).

This was done for research purposes.
